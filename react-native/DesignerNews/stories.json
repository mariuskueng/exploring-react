              "body": "Hi Zach, \r\n\r\nLet's just establish that a solid freelancer/team can do amazing things with just about any modern CMS today, free or paid. Last I checked there are over 400+ options when it comes to a \"CMS\" ranging in price from free to well into the 7 figures (yes, really). \r\n\r\nFor me, I find that Craft is a great fit for projects that need customized publishing workflows, a lot of dynamic content, and the design needs call for something considerably more than a \"theme\" can offer. I find its also a good fit for mid-sized projects where the client has established real business value that needs the backing of modern software but doesn't need/want (or simply can't afford) an \"enterprise\" solution (think projects in the $45k - $125k range). In short, they have real money they need to invest and they need room to grow. \r\n\r\nWhile its true that many people love WP for this, WP is not specifically designed for this, especially a tailored \"author experience.\" In cases where clients have specific business value in such things, like the Associated Press for example, they will save thousands of dollars in production hours over the course of the year with a tool like Craft. You could probably build the equivalent in something like WordPress, but its unlikely you could do it without breaking the upgrade path, using a number of 3rd party plugins, introducing security risks, and increasing the size of the code base you have to maintain and the number of vendors you have to work with to keep the system stable. \r\n\r\nThe main thing about Author Experience in a professional sense is to keep, as much as possible, a 1-to-1 relationship with what a thing does and what you call it. The more you take a tool like WordPress and customize it, the more you lose this 1-to-1 relationship. The outcome of this is increased training time, increased errors in production, and decreased output.

              "body_html": "<p>Hi Zach, </p>\n\n<p>Let&#39;s just establish that a solid freelancer/team can do amazing things with just about any modern CMS today, free or paid. Last I checked there are over 400+ options when it comes to a &quot;CMS&quot; ranging in price from free to well into the 7 figures (yes, really). </p>\n\n<p>For me, I find that Craft is a great fit for projects that need customized publishing workflows, a lot of dynamic content, and the design needs call for something considerably more than a &quot;theme&quot; can offer. I find its also a good fit for mid-sized projects where the client has established real business value that needs the backing of modern software but doesn&#39;t need/want (or simply can&#39;t afford) an &quot;enterprise&quot; solution (think projects in the $45k - $125k range). In short, they have real money they need to invest and they need room to grow. </p>\n\n<p>While its true that many people love WP for this, WP is not specifically designed for this, especially a tailored &quot;author experience.&quot; In cases where clients have specific business value in such things, like the Associated Press for example, they will save thousands of dollars in production hours over the course of the year with a tool like Craft. You could probably build the equivalent in something like WordPress, but its unlikely you could do it without breaking the upgrade path, using a number of 3rd party plugins, introducing security risks, and increasing the size of the code base you have to maintain and the number of vendors you have to work with to keep the system stable. </p>\n\n<p>The main thing about Author Experience in a professional sense is to keep, as much as possible, a 1-to-1 relationship with what a thing does and what you call it. The more you take a tool like WordPress and customize it, the more you lose this 1-to-1 relationship. The outcome of this is increased training time, increased errors in production, and decreased output. The more people responsible for content on a site, the more true this becomes. </p>\n\n<p>Because Craft is built from the ground up to have a 1-to-1 relationship (and yes, it sometimes falls short of this goal), it means that clients often don&#39;t have to be trained on it because it is obvious how it works from start to finish if we&#39;ve done our job right.

A symbol in a way, that you would recognize from  a distance. Like the Mac Donalds logo or the Shell logo.\r\n\r\nSo I just came up with the simple line to connect the letters. Also by making the logo responsive (smaller on mobile phones) I by chance came up with the 'O' with the line through it.\r\n\r\nSo, no real deep thought behind there, just a result of playing around with it :)",

      "comment": "Howdy!\r\n\r\nIn the days following the Peel Glass release, I decided to order it and see if it's good. I've been rocking the Peel *case* for a while and I'm really happy with it. It made sense to at least try.\r\n\r\nShipping & packaging: This thing will arrive intact. It shipped across the border (US → CA) and I received it in a hard cardboard box that protected the envelope package from any harm. Good to know because I believe continental packages for the Peel case were only a soft envelope, and it caused a lot of shipping damage.\r\n\r\nIncluded are a microfiber cloth, a dust sticker, and a \"LCD cleaner\" moist towel. There's a nice printed card with instructions to use the cloth, then the dust sticker on your phone's screen before placing the protector and pressing the bubbles away. All together, they do get your screen really clean.\r\n\r\nThe protector itself is a hard piece of glass, backed with a reasonably strong glue. You peel off a plastic backing, then apply it to the screen. The camera and home button holes make it easy to align.\r\n\r\nI applied it to the screen, and it formed a ton of bubbles. No worries, right? Well, contrary to flexible screen protectors, pushing the air out is a very difficult exercise.\r\n\r\nThe actual issue, though, is that unless you're in an admirably dust-free environment, you'll get tiny particles of dust or lint sticking when you peel off the protector's backing. These make the hard plastic tent around them, and since it's not flexible, it'll never hug small imperfections. So air remains around the tiniest thing.\r\n\r\nI probably could have considered myself done with my first try if I accepted seeing around four ~1mm round bubbles on my phone screen. The dust itself was too small to be visible, but the bubbles were very obvious, especially with the screen lit. Honestly, I didn't want this at all. So I pulled the protector off gently (this can be done easily enough – the glue won't do anything bad to your screen) and tried again.\r\n\r\nI am a very patient person. All in all, my best attempt in the next 1+ hour left me with two tiny bubbles. This is a product that Peel \"wouldn't release until it was perfect\". So I myself didn't really want to give up on it until it looked right, but I eventually had to conclude that it wouldn't happen.\r\n\r\nEspecially considering that an iPhone's screen itself is made of goddamn Gorilla Glass, a protector that expensive shouldn't be a hit-or-miss expense.\r\n\r\nIf your protector starts out with visual imperfections, then it's also at the day where it's done for and should be replaced. I can't advise anyone to buy this, honestly. At 40 CAD, it makes for a costly lesson :/\r\n\r\n**TLDR:**  If you're a careful person, you don't need it. If you tend to scratch your phone often, get something less extravagant.",

I&#39;ve been rocking the Peel <em>case</em> for a while and I&#39;m really happy with it. It made sense to at least try.</p>\n\n<p>Shipping &amp; packaging: This thing will arrive intact. It shipped across the border (US → CA) and I received it in a hard cardboard box that protected the envelope package from any harm. Good to know because I believe continental packages for the Peel case were only a soft envelope, and it caused a lot of shipping damage.</p>\n\n<p>Included are a microfiber cloth, a dust sticker, and a &quot;LCD cleaner&quot; moist towel. There&#39;s a nice printed card with instructions to use the cloth, then the dust sticker on your phone&#39;s screen before placing the protector and pressing the bubbles away. All together, they do get your screen really clean.</p>\n\n<p>The protector itself is a hard piece of glass, backed with a reasonably strong glue. You peel off a plastic backing, then apply it to the screen. The camera and home button holes make it easy to align.</p>\n\n<p>I applied it to the screen, and it formed a ton of bubbles. No worries, right? Well, contrary to flexible screen protectors, pushing the air out is a very difficult exercise.</p>\n\n<p>The actual issue, though, is that unless you&#39;re in an admirably dust-free environment, you&#39;ll get tiny particles of dust or lint sticking when you peel off the protector&#39;s backing. These make the hard plastic tent around them, and since it&#39;s not flexible, it&#39;ll never hug small imperfections. So air remains around the tiniest thing.</p>\n\n<p>I probably could have considered myself done with my first try if I accepted seeing around four ~1mm round bubbles on my phone screen. The dust itself was too small to be visible, but the bubbles were very obvious, especially with the screen lit. Honestly, I didn&#39;t want this at all. So I pulled the protector off gently (this can be done easily enough – the glue won&#39;t do anything bad to your screen) and tried again.</p>\n\n<p>I am a very patient person. All in all, my best attempt in the next 1+ hour left me with two tiny bubbles. This is a product that Peel &quot;wouldn&#39;t release until it was perfect&quot;. So I myself didn&#39;t really want to give up on it until it looked right, but I eventually had to conclude that it wouldn&#39;t happen.</p>\n\n<p>Especially considering that an iPhone&#39;s screen itself is made of goddamn Gorilla Glass, a protector that expensive shouldn&#39;t be a hit-or-miss expense.</p>\n\n<p>If your protector starts out with visual imperfections, then it&#39;s also at the day where it&#39;s done for and should be replaced. I can&#39;t advise anyone to buy this, honestly. At 40 CAD, it makes for a costly lesson :/</p>\n\n<p><strong>TLDR:</strong>  If you&#39;re a careful person, you don&#39;t need it. If you tend to scratch your phone often, get something less extravagant.</p>\n",
